      <description>An in-depth analysis on the selection through to successful implementation of front-office and back office systems. Rather than focusing on a generic implementation model, the objective is to highlight early detection of issues, system capabilities, skills transition, implementation risks, resolution and many other concerns unique to procuring new investment systems to ensure investment managers fully benefit from the new technology, information delivery and operational workflow.</description>

      <title>(Public) Constant Yield Amortisation: 3 Main Methodologies</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-11-23 Constant Yield Amortisation Methodologies</link>
      <description>There have been many questions regarding yield-dependent formulas such as duration and amortised book values due to different systems showing different numbers. Software vendors will not share their proprietary algorithm because it potentially raise more questions than answers. I attempt to give you the answer here, and also why most fund managers in Malaysia use the "least suitable" method recommended by one of the Big 4.</description>

      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-10 Data Maintenance Automation,  Accuracy, Timeliness and Self-Check Mechanism</link>
      <description>Case study on data management. This is not about data security, control and performance. Leave that to the IT guys. This topic focuses on reference, pricing, transactions and all other data that populates the investment system databases. It's one of the most complex process within the middle office function because a significant number of BAU issues will originate from here. How do you automate and improve the quality of data that goes into your system? Can you trust your source data? How fast does the team resolve breaks, say between custody record and contractual settlement? Does AI have a role to play here and is it worth the investment?</description>

      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Building an Innovative and Continuously Improving Team</link>
      <description>I had a staff who joined our team without any experience in investment. He was not confident enough to deal with many tasks independently and he was afraid to handle communications with the vendors. The first thing I did was to make sure he learn to be really good at one thing. As I trained, I made sure he not only asks questions but challenge me and throw ideas around so he doesn't feel his job is just to follow instructions. He was a fast learner and he became the expert in that subject, giving him the confidence to take on other tasks confidently. I've had other staff who were good at their job but stay out of contributing to ideas and innovation. It's subjective, but here are some useful pointers (these are my own opinion).</description>

      <title>Critical Risk Areas in the Procurement and Implementation Process</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Critical Risk Areas in the Procurement and Implementation Process</link>
      <description>It is a misconception that putting a strong project management in place can mitigate project risks. They are not wrong though, provided that the implementation plan is solid in the first place. However, project managers who have little experience in investment systems will end up just tracking project status. Way before signing the contract, you should know what issues to at least expect and establish a resolution plan. The conversion process is a major risk associated with delays. This is where the blame starts. Reports customisation - why leave it until its too late? There are other risks but my point here is, there is a way to manage these risks and don't leave it to the project managers to think about this. They will not get the answers from the vendors and users. Lastly, when you select the "wrong" system, you will have to live and deal with on your own for the next few years.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Custodians, Counterparties and Service Partners</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Dealing with Custodians, Counterparties and Service Partners</link>
      <description>They say no news is good news. Spending less time with your vendors means less issues. That is the ideal situation as you work seamlessly through the use of their product or services. After all, they say they understand your business very well. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. What you might encounter: they are not responsive, their answers fail to address your concerns, your request is not in their priority list, enhancements won't be considered until the next major release, change management gives you a quote that is out of your current year budget. Can you control these issues before on-boarding your service providers? Yes you can, by at least 50%. Many organisations sign-up not expecting many issues to crop up later because they do not have experienced specialists to consult them. One mistake is to assume the SLA is sufficient to protect them. There will always be gaps and potential issues. Your providers are not going to tell you that because they want you to be aligned to their model and not the other way. Can't blame them since they have many other clients and it is not feasible to allow too much flexibility to fit in to many different requirements.</description>

      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Failed Trade,  Delivery and Settlement Issues</link>
      <description>You dread the day when it happens. This triggers the panic button and it tends to disrupt an otherwise resourceful day. For a critical trade, following up with custodians/counterparties and escalating this to the fund managers mean there is a lot of explaining to do. From an asset managers perspective, as long as you manage cash flow projections, track settlement status and ensure instructions to custodians are in order, you are good and the rest is beyond your control. But how do you check very quickly that these are in order? Most probably you will be communicating back and forth with your team, but is there a more effcient solution?</description>

      <title>Investment Operations Is More Than Just Technology</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Investment Operations is More Than Just Technology</link>
      <description>Let's not get confused between the two. Technology improves the way we work. Operations executes the processes that are designed to attain the desired output. Execution can be performed by either automation or manual work. The ideal state is to shift every process to automation, but even in a fully automated environment, machines can't think for itself and cannot make decisions (for now). As the balance is shifted, roles and relevant skills to manage the processes and execution will change. It is important to distinguish between the two and plan in advance for organisational changes before rushing into buying new systems. Do not think that having new technologies automatically improves your operations.</description>

      <title>Investment Operations Talent and Training in Malaysia</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Investment Operations Talent and Training in Malaysia</link>
      <description>This discussion may be disputed by some, but here are some of my experiences and thoughts on why we can do better to improve our skills and knowledge. We are comfortable being followers and let the consultants and vendors lead the way because we don't want to risk being blamed for any failures.  There is lack of innovation in the local industry. Another is the lack of depth and limited choices of training. Too many securities-related training are taken straight out of the textbook, with a few case studies thrown in. Specialised and niche topics relevant to investment operations are less-likely to be well-received by organisers because their target is the mass-market and hence prefer generic topics. We need the right courses out there to build the right skillset. Financial institutions and regulators do not prioritise training nor give enough focus on investment operations - despite the fact that middle and back office staff make up the majority of people in investment organisations and that they perform or support many critical roles such as compliance, monitoring risks, fraud-detection and delivering information.</description>

      <description>You will probably have heard of the inverted pyramid in an organisation structure. Conceptually, it looks like a great model that creates an effectively-run organisation. But, did some companies interpret the pyramid differently? At the bottom is a proportionately small team of workers doing the "real" work, who report to managers who report to more senior managers who report to more senior people. Input and decision-making trickles down one way. Anyone?</description>

      <description>We take a look what functions you can outsource to external parties. Should you outsource your entire middle office or partially outsource some of the functions and keep the rest in-house? We discuss about different configurations that is most suitable for your type of organisation and requirements. Key areas include operational and cost impact, data ownership and control, governance, security, licensing, cloud computing, etc. to assess whether these initiatives are beneficial or restrictive to your main objectives.</description>

      <title>[Public] Risk and Compliance</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Risk and Compliance</link>
      <description>This is undoubtedly a significant and huge topic on its own so much so that every investment management company spend huge resources just to make sure the message is put across all their employees.  Whatever you call your department or the risk area you are operating within - enterprise risk, operational risk, ethics, AML/Sanctions, IT/cyber risk, investment risk, risk management, etc. - there are fundamentally two things that you are trying to protect: the company's reputation and avoiding substantial losses. These can occur from rogue trades, weak contracts, scandals, corruption, mismanagement, pandemic, ignorance of regulations, market conditions, cross-border culture, etc. It is a huge challenge to even ensure these are communicated effectively to employees, let alone preventing it. My former employer, State Street did an impressive job with managing risks and communicating its importance. In future, I hope to write more about risk or even better, invite contributors who are experts in this field. For me, I can write a lot about operational risk related to systems implementation and trade cycle (settlement, manual process, technical, etc.). So watch this space.</description>

      <title>Should you build a data warehouse</title>
      <dc:creator>Chen Xihui</dc:creator>
      <link>https://middle-office.netlify.app/resources/2020-07-01 Should You Build a Data Warehouse</link>
      <description>This is a large project on its own. To undertake this project, you need to know what you are using it for, why you cannot pull data directly from source and if your source data is clean and understand the flow of data as it integrates from multiple sources. Otherwise, you would have spent a lot of time building, tweaking and maintaining the data warehouse without eventually serving its ipurpose. You are better off writing stored procedures or access from Java/R/Python that can guarantee a much higher retention of data integrity and near real-time data. Most BI tools allow you to connect to multiple databases but I wouldn't advise building non-shareable code into reports. Common concern is latency issue but think about optimising your infrastructure. Most databases are designed to handle large numbers of concurrent access. In many cases, it is the front-end applications that are slow. If there are many external programs, eg. risk/performance requiring only selective data, then it make sense to build a simple data warehouse.</description>

      <description>This article potentially invites a storm. It relates to business process re-engineering right through to investment systems implementation. All types of investment systems - front and back-office, risk, performance, etc. Project management and technology are strengths of of these big consulting firms. The rest - selection, testing, POC, conversion, reporting, investment outsourcing - consider other specialists. Implementation of investment systems is not dependent on the most advanced technology or the best project management practices. Its success depends a lot on factors that require strong domain knowledge which I will discuss in detail.</description>
