They are not wrong though, provided that the implementation plan is solid in the first place. However, project managers who have little experience in investment systems will end up just tracking project status. Way before signing the contract, you should know what issues to at least expect and establish a resolution plan. The conversion process is a major risk associated with delays. This is where the blame starts. Reports customisation - why leave it until its too late? There are other risks but my point here is, there is a way to manage these risks and don't leave it to the project managers to think about this. They will not get the answers from the vendors and users. Lastly, when you select the \"wrong\" system, you will have to live and deal with on your own for the next few years.",

As I trained him, I made sure he not only asks questions but challenge me and throw ideas around so he doesn't feel his job is just to follow instructions. He was a fast learner and he became the expert in that subject, giving him the confidence to take on other tasks confidently. I've had other staff who were good at their job but stay out of contributing to ideas and innovation. It's subjective, but here are some useful pointers (these are my own opinion).",

But, first things first, cultivate a cheerful environment.\nMotivate. Motivation is an individual thing. With the first point in mind, you learn what motivates the team member and the team as a whole.\nAllow and encourage them to be open and not to be afraid of speaking up.\nGathering everyone for a meeting to come up with ideas there and then does not effectively pick their brains. The best ideas are more likely to come through spontaneously during casual chats and they come in bits and pieces over time for you to put together.\nTrain them well. If possible, personally train them too. It shows respect.\nGuide them from the beginning, or at the very least, give directions. “Throwing them into the sea” does not work for everyone and may demotivate the staff or lead to selfishness in the workplace. You can be more ruthless at a later stage. Genuinely helping people to improve is reciprocated with gratitude and dedication.\nMake sure they don’t get too comfortable and complacent with their responsibilities. Take on different tasks, be all-rounders and stay competitive.\nGive them time to seek new knowledge. Inspire learning and sharing culture. It gives a sense of purpose and value where career and personal development is concerned.\nWhere possible, give them the freedom and flexibility to design their work. It gives them more ownership.\nStop breathing down their necks, a.k.a. micro-managing. Not only does it irritate people but it puts people on defensive mode. Give them enough breathing space, communicate expectations clearly and fairly. Make a clear distinction between expecting your staff to set their standards to “the department’s level” and to “your level”. The latter is egoism and insecurity. You are not trusting that your staff can bring out a better version of your work. It hinders originality. A homogeneous work culture has the opposite effect of the creative environment you want to foster.\nIf a mistake happens, discuss about immediate resolution first, followed by a review to prevent future occurrence. Focusing on who should be blamed does not help to resolve the issue any better.\nPenalising for mistakes create a fear of reporting the issue immediately and openly. Be careful how it is implemented. It is meant for everyone to learn from mistakes and improve, not to punish someone who may just be a victim of a weak control structure.\nThere will always be one in the team who is not interested to improve or contribute much and is probably more interested in office politics. These people drag the team down, they’re not worth your time.\n\n\n\n",

Execution can be performed by either automation or manual work. The ideal state is to shift every process to automation, but even in a fully automated environment, machines can't think for itself and cannot make decisions (for now). As the balance is shifted, roles and relevant skills to manage the processes and execution will change.

We are comfortable being followers and let the consultants and vendors lead the way because we don't want to risk being blamed for any failures.  There is lack of innovation in the local industry. Another is the lack of depth and limited choices of training. Too many securities-related training are taken straight out of the textbook, with a few case studies thrown in. Specialised and niche topics relevant to investment operations are less-likely to be well-received by organisers because their target is the mass-market and hence prefer generic topics. We need the right courses out there to build the right skillset. Financial institutions and regulators do not prioritise training nor give enough focus on investment operations - despite the fact that middle and back office staff make up the majority of people in investment organisations and that they perform or support many critical roles such as compliance, monitoring risks, fraud-detection and delivering information.",

Otherwise, you would have spent a lot of time building, tweaking and maintaining the data warehouse without eventually serving its ipurpose. You are better off writing stored procedures or access from Java/R/Python that can guarantee a much higher retention of data integrity and near real-time data. Most BI tools allow you to connect to multiple databases but I wouldn't advise building non-shareable code into reports. Common concern is latency issue but think about optimising your infrastructure. Most databases are designed to handle large numbers of concurrent access. In many cases, it is the front-end applications that are slow. If there are many external programs, eg. risk/performance requiring only selective data, then it make sense to build a simple data warehouse.",

Whatever you call your department or the risk area you are operating within - enterprise risk, operational risk, ethics, AML/Sanctions, IT/cyber risk, investment risk, risk management, etc. - there are fundamentally two things that you are trying to protect: the company's reputation and avoiding substantial losses. These can occur from rogue trades, weak contracts, scandals, corruption, mismanagement, pandemic, ignorance of regulations, market conditions, cross-border culture, etc. It is a huge challenge to even ensure these are communicated effectively to employees, let alone preventing it. My former employer, State Street did an impressive job with managing risks and communicating its importance. In future, I hope to write more about risk or even better, invite contributors who are experts in this field. For me, I can write a lot about operational risk related to systems implementation and trade cycle (settlement, manual process, technical, etc.). So watch this space.",
